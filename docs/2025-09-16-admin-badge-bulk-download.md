## Add admin bulk badge download quick action

- **Date:** 2025-09-16
- **Author:** codex

### Summary
- Added `/admin/download_all_badges` endpoint that streams a ZIP archive of generated badge images for every guest and records newly printed badges.
- Inserted a "Download All Badges" button in the admin dashboard quick actions to trigger the bulk archive download.
- Documented the enhancement in the changelog for visibility.

### Files Affected
- `app/routes/admin.py`
- `templates/admin/dashboard.html`
- `CHANGELOG.md`

### Rationale
Admins requested a single-click way to download badges for every guest instead of printing them individually. Bundling them into an archive reduces manual effort, while updating the badge print flags preserves downstream tracking.

### Implementation Notes
- The handler streams an in-memory ZIP file populated with PNG badges generated by the existing `create_magnacode_badge_working` helper. Any guests that fail validation or image generation are skipped and logged.
- Newly printed badges receive `BadgePrinted=True` and a timestamp before persisting back to the CSV store; previously marked badges retain their original metadata.
- The quick action is a simple anchor styled consistently with other dashboard shortcuts and points at the new GET endpoint, prompting a direct file download.
