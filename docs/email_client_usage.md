# Email Client Usage

The admin email client allows sending bulk emails to guests. Recipients can be chosen in three ways:

1. **Select from the list** – use the search box to filter and select multiple guests.
2. **Filter by role** – leave the list empty and choose a role to send to all guests with that role.
3. **Manual entry** – paste email addresses or guest IDs into the *Manual entry* box. Separate entries with commas or new lines.

If both manual emails and selections are provided, all addresses are combined. Leaving everything blank sends the email to all guests.
