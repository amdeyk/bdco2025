## Center MagnaCode badge content

- **Date:** 2025-09-15
- **Author:** codex

### Summary
Reworked the MagnaCode badge generator to stack guest name, role, ID, and QR code vertically in the center while removing the phone number from the design.

### Files Affected
- `app/routes/admin.py`
- `CHANGELOG.md`

### Rationale
The centered layout matches the updated conference branding direction, improves readability by enlarging the guest name, and avoids exposing phone numbers on printed badges.
