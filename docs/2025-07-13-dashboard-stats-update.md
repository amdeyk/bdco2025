## Update admin dashboard statistics

- **Date:** 2025-07-13
- **Author:** codex

### Summary
The dashboard cards now show the number of delegates and an overall attendance count. Attendance counts faculty and delegate guests who have either checked in or received meal coupons.

### Files Affected
- `app/routes/admin.py`
- `templates/admin/dashboard.html`
- `CHANGELOG.md`

### Rationale
These metrics better reflect conference participation by highlighting delegates separately and showing attendance beyond simple registration.
