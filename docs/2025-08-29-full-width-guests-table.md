### Summary
Expanded the admin guests table to occupy the full width of large displays by removing restrictive widths and enabling responsive horizontal scrolling.

### Files Affected
- `templates/admin/all_guests.html`
- `static/css/styles.css`
- `CHANGELOG.md`

### Rationale
Improves visibility and usability of guest data on desktop by allowing the table to use all available horizontal space while maintaining responsiveness on smaller screens.
